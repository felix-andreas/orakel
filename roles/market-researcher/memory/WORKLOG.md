## 2026-07-23 — first scan, backlog seeded

Model: fable (high). First run since founding; backlog was empty.

- Built `tools/scan/` (stable-rust crate, not cargo -Zscript — nightly absent from this
  box): pages Gamma `/events`, flattens to CSV, prints horizon/volume/tag summary.
- Scanned top 2000 open events by 24h volume -> 26,539 open market rows. Freeze:
  `roles/market-researcher/data/scans/2026-07-23-events-vol24.csv.r2.json` (11MB -> R2).
- Landscape: Sports 9.8k mkts / Politics $2.4B vol; 87% of open markets <$10k volume;
  ~11k markets resolve <=7d. Recurring series = crypto (deep, avoid) + 49-city daily
  temperature bucket families (~$3.2M open, resolved instances back to April).
- Probed temp families live: Seoul post-peak fully converged (0.9995); Hong Kong 16:40
  local still bid 0.016 on a near-dead 34°C leg vs 5h of 33°C METAR prints; London
  pre-peak with genuine spread (26°C at 0.50). Resolution stations differ per city (HKO
  vs Wunderground airport pages) — structural fine print confirmed in descriptions.
- Idea filed: `ideas/2026-07-23-temp-daily-max-truncation-lag.md` (status: backlog) —
  intraday truncation repricing in daily temp families; falsification = window-open
  Herfindahl test + dead-leg collapse-time backtest + truncated-model log-loss vs
  de-vigged mids, on months of resolved city-days.
